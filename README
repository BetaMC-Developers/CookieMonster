CookieMonster! - iConomy Money and Items for PvM

Description:
This is a continuation of Coelho's initial CookieMonster
CookieMonster is based off of the inactive iMonster, however uses none of the code from it, 
so it is extremely lightweight and fast. 


Features:
configurable item drops and economy reward for each monster
configurable econoy reward for items used to kill monsters
Supports iConomy & BOSeconomy
Ability to change entity drops with drop-rate.
Ability to add minimum and maximum money drops for randomness
Extremely small and weightless code

doesn't allow to damage a creature/mobspawner if penalty is greater than account balance
option to only drop items for a direct kill (stops autofarmers)
option to replace drop items globally
configurable messages (including if there is no reward)


Commands:
/cookiemonster (cm) reload		reloads settings from configuration file


To-Do:
? import itemsDB from bettershop to check against config (check if valid items entered as drops)
permissions? (maybe permission to kill without penalty?)
penalties/rewards for killing players (even groups)
